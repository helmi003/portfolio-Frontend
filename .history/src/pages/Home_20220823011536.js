            I am a software developer. I have experience as a full stack
            developer but I lean more to the front end and I have built a lot of
            web apps and some mobile apps. Also, I am always learning and
            experimenting with new technologies (currently learning about the
            ethereum blockchain) and other topics other than software
            engineering.
