              I am from chittagong, Bangladesh. A place of beauty and nature.
              Since my childhood, i love art and design. I always try to design
              stuff with my unique point of view. I also love to create things
              that can be usefull to others.

              I started coding since I was in high school. Coding is also an art
              for me. I love it and now I have the opportunity to design along
              with the coding. I find it really interesting and I enjoyed the
              process a lot.

              place.
